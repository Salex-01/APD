    there is only one message in the network
    this message is emitted by a (single) initiator (called InitNode)
    it is transmitted to all the neighbor nodes if it has not been seen yet.
    
Algorithm: (the message is called "water")

1:if InitNode then
2:  send the walker to all neighbors
3:  stop

4:forever
5:  receive water from some node N
6:  if EndNode then
7:    do nothing! 
8:  else
9:    send the walker to all neighbors
10:    stop
