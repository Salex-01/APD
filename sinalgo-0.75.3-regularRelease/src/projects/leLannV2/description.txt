--  LeLann algorithm  --

	Each node that can become the leader sends a message containing its ID to its neighbor (on its right)
	Each candidate node keeps the lowest ID it has seen
	Each node repeats the messages it receives to its neighbor (on its right) if the ID is lower than the lowest that has been seen yet
	If a node receives a message containing an ID lower to its own, it knows it is not the leader
	If a node receives a message containing its own ID, it knows it is the leader
	
Algorithm: (the message is called "water")

if InitNode
	send own ID to right neighbor
	minID = ownID

forever
	receive ID from left neighbor
	if ID == ownID
		leader = true
	else
		if ID < minID
			minID = ID
			leader = false
			send ID to right neighbor
